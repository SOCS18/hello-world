First repository to learn how to use GitHub

This is my first time using GitHub and I'm still trying to get familiar with this website. At the time of this edit, I'm currently experienced in C, Java, and I'm currently learning how to use C# in conjunction with the Unity Engine. I love to play video games, watch anime and listen to lots of different kinds of music.
